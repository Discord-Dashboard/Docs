## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Step 1: Install the CLI">

        To create a new Discord-Dashboard project, start by using our dedicated CLI tool. This tool will guide you through the setup process, allowing you to quickly scaffold a new project with all the necessary configurations.

        First, ensure that you have the CLI installed globally:

        <CodeGroup>

            ```sh Yarn
            yarn global add @discord-dashboard/cli
            ```

            ```sh NPM
            npm install -g @discord-dashboard/cli
            ```

            ```sh PNPM
            pnpm add -g @discord-dashboard/cli
            ```

        </CodeGroup>

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 2: Create a Project">

        Once the CLI is installed, you can create your project by running the following command:

        ```sh
        discord-dashboard init
        ```

        The CLI will guide you through a series of questions to help set up your new project,
        creating a configuration file and initializing the project with basic features tailored to your needs.
        Answer them or simply keep them default for now:

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 3: Create the .env File">

        After the CLI completes, it will output a sample `.env` file containing a custom-generated session secret.
        Please copy this content and paste it into a new `.env` file in your project directory.

        <Warning>
            Update the default Discord OAuth2 Client ID, Secret, and Assistants Technologies Token with your own values. [How to do it?](soon)
        </Warning>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 4: Import the Instance">

        Next, you will need to import the Discord-Dashboard instance in your main application file.
        This instance can be found in the `discord-dashboard/instance.{js,ts}` file.

        <CodeGroup>

            ```ts TypeScript
            import dashboard from './discord-dashboard/instance';

            dashboard.start()
                .then((instance) => {
                    console.log("Discord-Dashboard Instance is up and running!");
                });
            ```

            Or, if you prefer using dynamic imports:

            ```js JavaScript
            const dashboard = require('./discord-dashboard/instance');

            dashboard.start()
                .then((instance) => {
                    console.log("Discord-Dashboard Instance is up and running!");
                });
            ```

        </CodeGroup>

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Step 5: Run the Project">

        Finally, you can run your project and access the application in your web browser!
