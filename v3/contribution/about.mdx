## Getting Started

This document outlines the guidelines and procedures for contributing to our project on GitHub.
Our project is organized with a main repository (`Workspace`) containing essential files and a packages directory with multiple
submodules (e.g., `typings`, `core`, `react`, `base-theme`, etc.). Below, youâ€™ll find steps for setting up the workspace, updating submodules, and ensuring
the workspace reflects the latest versions of all submodules.

<Info>
    To make sure everything will be working as expected, please use the following versions of Yarn and Node.js for the contribution process:

    - **Yarn**: 1.22.22
    - **Node.js**: v20.16.0
</Info>

## Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Code Quality**: Ensure that all code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to the projectâ€™s coding standards.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, concise commit messages. Reference related issues or features where applicable.
- **Branching**: Always create a new branch for your changes. Use descriptive names (e.g., feature/new-theme, fix/bug-123).
- **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs to the appropriate branch (usually develop or v3). Provide a detailed description of what the PR does.
- **Reviews**: PRs require at least one approval before merging. Address all review comments before requesting a re-review.

### Workflow

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the workspace repository to your GitHub account.
- **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work.
- **Commit Often**: Make frequent commits with descriptive messages.
- **Keep Your Fork Up to Date**: Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository to avoid merge conflicts.

## Setting Up the Workspace

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="1. Clone the Workspace Repository">

        First, clone the workspace repository to your local machine:

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Discord-Dashboard/Workspace.git
        cd Workspace
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Initialize and Update Submodules">

        The `packages` directory contains all submodules. Initialize and update them with the following commands:

        ```sh
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Install Dependencies">

        After updating the submodules, install the dependencies for the entire workspace:

        ```sh
        yarn install
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4. Build All Packages">

        To build all packages and keep listening to the changes, type:

        ```sh
        yarn run watch
        ```

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Updating Submodules and Workspace

When a submodule (e.g., `core`) needs to be updated, please follow this:


<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="1. Updating a Specific Submodule">

       1. Navigate to the Submodule Directory:
        ```sh
        cd packages/core
        ```

        2. Checkout the Desired Branch (e.g., `main`):
        ```sh
        git checkout main
        ```

        3.	Pull the Latest Changes:
        ```sh
        git pull origin main
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Updating All Submodules">

        To update all submodules to their latest versions:

        ```sh
        git submodule update --remote --merge
        ```

        This command fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repositories of all submodules.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Committing Submodule Updates">

        After updating the submodules, navigate back to the root of the workspace and commit the changes:

        ```sh
        cd ../..
        git add packages/core
        git commit -m "Updated core submodule to the latest version"
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4. Syncing the Main Workspace with Submodules">

        To ensure the workspace reflects the latest changes from the submodules:

        1. Navigate to the Workspace Root:
        ```sh
        cd /path/to/workspace
        ```

        2. Update All Submodules:
        ```sh
        git submodule update --remote --merge
        ```

        3. Test and Build: Ensure everything is up to date by running tests and rebuilding the workspace:
        ```sh
        yarn test
        yarn build
        ```

        4. Commit changes:
        ```sh
        git add .
        git commit -m "Updated workspace to reflect latest submodule changes"
        git push origin your-branch
        ```


    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="5. Submitting Your Changes">

        Once your changes are tested and ready:

        1. Push Your Branch to your forked repository:
        ```sh
        git push origin your-branch
        ```

        2. Create a Pull Request: Go to the main repository on GitHub and create a PR from your branch.


    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="1. Fetch Upstream Changes">

        To sync your fork with the upstream repository:
        ```sh
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout main
        git merge upstream/main
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Rebase Your Branch">

        If youâ€™re working on a feature branch:
        ```sh
        git checkout your-branch
        git rebase main
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Force Push (if needed)">

        If youâ€™ve rebased:
        ```sh
        git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch
        ```

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- **Regular Syncing**: Frequently sync your fork and branches with the upstream repository to avoid conflicts.
- **Atomic Commits**: Make sure each commit is a complete, working change.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for any new features or changes to existing functionality.
- **Testing**: Run all tests before pushing changes. Add new tests for any new features.

By following these guidelines and procedures, youâ€™ll ensure a smooth contribution process and help
maintain the quality and consistency of the project. Happy coding! ðŸš€
